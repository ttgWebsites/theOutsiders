					<li data-theme="b">Rich vs. Poor</li>
					<li data-theme="d">Much of the novel's conflict revolves around one thing, the gap between the rich and the poor.</li>
<li data-theme="c">The greaser gang is made up of underprivileged teens whose home lives lack sustenance, meanwhile the Socs gang is made up largely of the richer teens from upper-class families who have been gifted wealth without experiencing any consequences.</li>
<li data-theme="d">It is clear that the differences between the two groups are much smaller than the hatred they show towards one another would suggest.</li>
<li data-theme="c">When Ponyboy meets Socs girls he comes to realize that they have many of the same interests and desires as one another.</li>
<li data-theme="d">It appears as if the hatred stems from jealousy on both sides.</li>
<li data-theme="c">The greasers view the Socs as privileged and seem to envy the believed easy life they have, meanwhile the Socs seem to envy the greasers easy going lifestyle as they have no one to report to and seem to be free.</li>
<li data-theme="d">Despite the ongoing conflicts between the two groups it seems as if there is optimism that the gap can be bridged and that the two groups can one day get along.</li>
<li data-theme="c">The two groups are far more closer than any of them would admit, and it seems the only thing separating the two is swallowing one's pride.</li>
				</ul>
				<ul data-role="listview" data-inset="true">
					<li data-theme="b">The Dangers of Male and Female Relationships</li>
					<li data-theme="d">The greaser and Socs relations with one another seems pretty well defined when the novel begins.</li>
<li data-theme="c">They despise one another, and are willing to fight for their views if necessary.</li>
<li data-theme="d">It does not usually escalate more than this, and the feud seems straight forward, however when Socs girls become involved the feud takes on new heights.</li>
<li data-theme="c">When the Socs girls, Cherry Valence and Marcia, are friendly with Ponyboy and Johnny Cade it is obvious that the ordinary Socs and greaser relationship will be greatly changed.</li>
<li data-theme="d">The Socs view this as an invasion into their clique, and that the greasers have finally over-stepped their boundaries.</li>
<li data-theme="c">It is as if the girls belong to the Socs and the greasers have infringed upon this.</li>
<li data-theme="d">The simple friendly discussion between Ponyboy and Cherry leads to the death of one Socs, as well as a full out gang brawl at the end of the novel, far more widening the lines of hatred between the two groups.</li>
<li data-theme="c">It goes to show that once females are brought into the picture, males tend to act far more aggressively to assert their dominance.</li>
