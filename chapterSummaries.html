					<li data-theme="d">The novel opens with Ponyboy Curtis, the narrator, telling of his experience walking home from a movie one day.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">The movie was one of Paul Newman's films, and Ponyboy thinks he slightly envies his looks, however he also is pretty proud of his greaser look with his slicked back hair.</li>

					<li data-theme="c">As a greaser it is not safe being alone due to the attention it draws from another clique, the Socials, or Socs.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">The Socs are made up of the richer teens from the West Side of town, they see themselves as far better than the greasers, however they are often more vile and seek out fights.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">Ponyboy explains that when he was younger his mother and father died in a car crash, therefore leaving his eldest brother, Darrel 'Darry' in charge.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">Darry looks out for Ponyboy, and expects him to stay out of the normal mischievous miscreant behavior of the greasers.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">He sees Ponyboy's potential and longs for him to have a better life.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">Ponyboy also has another brother, Sodapop, who is the middle child.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">Sodapop is a very fun-loving character and is often up to mischief, however he is also good-intentioned.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">Ponyboy switches back to discussing his walk home as he has now noticed that he is being trailed by a red Chevy Corvair, a typical Socs car.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">Ponyboy hastens his walk as he remembers one of his fellow greasers, Johnny Cade, was beaten severely by a Socs group while he was walking alone one day.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">Sure enough the Chevy pulls up to Ponyboy, and five Socs pile out surrounding him.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">One pulls a blade and threatens him before they begin to beat him senseless as he cries for help.</li>

					<li data-theme="c">Darry begins to scold Ponyboy for being out alone, however the other greasers recognize this is not the time for chastising.</li>

					<li data-theme="c">Dally discusses his former girlfriend, Sylvia, a greaser girl, and Ponyboy gets to thinking about what it would be like to date the likes of a Socs girl.</li>

					<li data-theme="c">They sit behind two Socs girls and Dally does his best to make them feel uncomfortable by talking dirty so that they will overhear him.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">Sure enough one of the girls, Cherry Valence, turns around and tells him to grow up.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">Dally is shocked, he decides to get up and buy some sodas, leaving Ponyboy in the company of the girls.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">Ponyboy begins to talk to Cherry, and it does not appear awkward at all for a conversation between a Greaser and Socs.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">They seem to hit it off and end up discussing Ponyboy's brother Sodapop and it appears Cherry has a soft spot for him.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">Eventually Dally returns with cokes and offers one to Cherry, only for her to splash it in his face.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">Dally is very embarrassed and tries to act tough, however Johnny, seemingly out of character, calls him out causing him to leave.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">Johnny and Ponyboy sit down next to the girls and enjoy their company until they are interrupted by news from Two-Bit that Dally has gone and slashed the tires of Tim Shepard's car.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">Tim is another greaser, and this is not acceptable among greasers.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">It appears as if they plan to fight, and being that they are part of two separate greaser cliques, it is clear that Johnny and Ponyboy will have to come to Dally's defense.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">Seeing as the fight has yet to happen, Ponyboy remains with the girls.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">He and Cherry go off to buy popcorn and discuss the greasers and Socs.</li>

					<li data-theme="c">Johnny and Two-Bit are surprised by this as they see the brothers relationship completely differently.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">The conversation then switches to Socs and greasers again, and shockingly it appears that he and Cherry both have quite a bit in common despite the different cliques they are apart of.
					<li data-theme="c">However it soon switches to an argument as Ponyboy sees the Socs as privileged, selfish people who have nothing better to do than start trouble, while Cherry believes the greasers pity themselves too much and therefore pick fights because they lack self confidence.</li>
					<li data-theme="d"> The argument is futile and eventually it is given up.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">As they continue the walk a blue Ford Mustang, the car of Bob Sheldon, Cherry’s boyfriend, passes them.</li>
