					<li data-theme="d">The Outsiders follows the story of a teenage boy struggling to grow up and mature during a difficult point in his life. The protagonist, Ponyboy Curtis, lives with his two older brothers, as both of his parents have died. Ponyboy and his brothers are part of a gang known as the greasers. The greasers come from the poorer neighborhoods, wear blue-jeans, white t-shirts, and slick back their hair. The greasers also have an ongoing feud with a rival gang from the upper-class part of town, known as the Socs. Throughout the novel, it is clear the tension between the two gangs, and it culminates in one of the Socs being killed while he attempts to kill Ponyboy. The death of the Socs member leads to several other negative events; Ponyboy and another greaser run away for a time, and a large fight between the two gangs looms. Eventually the novel finishes following the greaser-Socs fight, and Ponyboy goes through a great personal transition. He recognizes that despite his and the other greasersâ€™ situation in life, there is still much beauty in the world.</li>
